A reporting system in Python and batch. It solves a computer science Olympiad problem contained in the "Projekt J.Skryptowe.pdf" file, then saves the report to a .pdf file in the "Reports" folder and appends the report to the "Backup.pdf" file. More information is available in the manual and documentation. 

To run the program, simply click the batch file to download the necessary libraries, and then click the "BAT EXE" to run the project.
